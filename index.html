		<p>about: 
			A web site for the technology hobbyist. The goal of the web site is to take a novice through the initial phases of acquiring a new technology skill.  The lessons will presume you have no prior exposure to the technology being explained.  I will include references to other sites and links for more detailed description, but the overall content will be concise in its delivery.
			Learning can only start when the student begins doing what is being taught.  The aim of this site is to focus on the doing.
